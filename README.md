# JavaScript Challenges + Leetcode Solutions

Welcome to my 30-Day JavaScript Challenge! This challenge is designed to help me improve my JavaScript skills through daily coding exercises. Each day, I'll be challenging myself with a new problem to solve, covering various topics and concepts within the language.

## Getting Started

To participate in this challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Fork this Repository**: Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account. This will create a personal copy of the challenge repository that you can work on independently.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
